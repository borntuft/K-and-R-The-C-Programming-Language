# K-and-R-The-C-Programming-Language
Examples and Code from The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository will contain all of my source code that I have created personally from the exercises within The C Programming Language Book.

I am not a computer science student, nor am I a professional programmer. I am simply a hobbiest that started to learn the C language on March 18, 2018.
