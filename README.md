# K-and-R-The-C-Programming-Language
Examples and Code from The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository will contain all of my source code that I have created personally from the exercises within The C Programming Language Book.

I am not a computer science student, nor am I a professional programmer. I am simply a hobbiest that started to learn the C language on March 18, 2018.

Update: June 17, 2019

So the challange didn't go as well as planned. I started my journey with K&R in March of 2018 and ended abrutly in May of 2018. I intend to finish this book at some point in 2019. For now, I am working on C Primer Plys, Sixth Edition by Prata which can be found here: https://github.com/borntuft/C-Primer-Plus-Sixth-Edition
